    fullDescription: "Still to this day, I am not quite sure what to call this piece, as evidenced by the title and description of it. I've been calling it a hutch, but it can also be used as a room divider, cabinet, bookshelf, or just decorative ornament-holder. This piece was envisioned after seeing some Pinterest inspiration, but was designed in Fusion 360 by myself and crafted over the course of three months in 2024. My favorite parts include the curved 90 degree shelves, and the variable-sized shelves on the upper section. Sold for $3000.",

    fullDescription: 'This mirror was inspired by Michael Alm and his distinctive style of laminating precisely cut pieces of Baltic Birch plywood to create eye-catching pieces. Originally designed to be a desktop, this piece was pivoted mid-project when I decided that would be entirely too large to complete. I then decided to CNC the Wave Mirror shape and power carve relief on the edges to create an eye-catching piece that merges straight-lines and sharp corners in the pattern, with the overall smooth and soft shape of the mirror. This piece is displayed in my home, but I hope to iterate on this concept in the future.',
